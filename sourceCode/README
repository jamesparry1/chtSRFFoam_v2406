Running the Allwmake script will compile the following solvers and boundary condition:
-chtMultiRegionSRFFoam
-buoyantSRFPimpleFoam
-turbulentTemperatureCoupledBaffleMixedMixingPlane
These have been implemented in OpenFOAM-v2006.

For the mixing plane boundary condition, the number of tangential division at the interface is set to 360.
To change this, change the value in the "mixingPlane.cpp" file for the variable "numOfDiv".

To clean these run the Allwclean script
